Scene understanding has always been an essential task in computer vision, and image description or image captioning is one of the major areas of AI research since it aims to mimic the human ability to compress an enormous amount of visual information in a few sentences. The task aims to provide short but detailed descriptions of the image in a few sentences and requires the use of techniques from computer vision and natural language processing. Recent developments in deep learning and the availability of image caption datasets such as Flikr and COCO have enabled significant research in the area. Our experiment on training the model using Flickr8k data using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an encoder and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as decoder shows that our model is capable of generating some reasonable captions.
